Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) — Background:

Siphiwe went home for a long weekend. You would think that he would come back rested and
happy, having eaten his mother’s amazing food all day long instead of his usual takeaways, in one
of the most beautiful places in the country too. You would be wrong.

In class he was frequently staring out the window with an intense frown on his face. And between
classes he didn’t say much and didn’t eat like his usual ravenous self either. When somebody
jokingly told him that you can’t live on water alone, his answer was serious. “No ... no, you
cannot.”

After a lot of prodding, he finally told you what had happened. His father had sat him down, and
explained that once he graduates, he would no longer be receiving any money from the family.
No car repayments, no entertainment allowance, no rent ... Nothing. Siphiwe had never thought
about what would happen after graduation. He was so focussed on his studies, that it had never
even occurred to him that he might have to fend for himself in less than two years.

Siphiwe was worried that he might not be able to maintain his lifestyle if he had to pay for
everything himself. What would he have to sacrifice to make ends meet? He didn’t even have a
girlfriend yet, and if he couldn’t go out anymore, how would he ever find her? And even worse, if
he did find her, how would he keep her without any money to spend on her? The myriad
questions were spinning around in his head with no end in sight.

You pointed out to him that he needed some hard data. Without data he couldn’t know if he even
had financial trouble looming, let alone what he could do to improve his situation if he did.

In this Portfolio of Evidence, you will be creating an application that can be used for personal
budget planning. That should help Siphiwe understand his potential problems much better.
